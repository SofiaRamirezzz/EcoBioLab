# Environmental Impact Analysis

## Introduction

This research report aims to analyze the environmental impact of various factors and provide insights into their carbon footprint, water usage, and biodiversity impact. The analysis will be conducted using a dataset containing information about different factors.

## Methodology

1. Import the necessary libraries for analysis (e.g., pandas, numpy).
2. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Define a function to calculate the environmental impact of each factor.
4. Within the function, calculate the carbon footprint, water usage, and biodiversity impact for each factor using the provided formulas.
5. Calculate the overall environmental impact score by summing up the individual impacts and dividing by the quantity of the factor.
6. Add the calculated values to the DataFrame.
7. Return the updated DataFrame.
8. Example usage: Instantiate a DataFrame with sample data, call the function to calculate the environmental impact, and print the result.

## Code Implementation

Please refer to the [environmental_impact_analysis.py](environmental_impact_analysis.py) file for the code implementation.

## Conclusion

The environmental impact analysis conducted in this project provides valuable insights into the carbon footprint, water usage, and biodiversity impact of various factors. By quantifying the impact of each factor, decision-makers can prioritize environmentally-friendly options and work towards mitigating negative effects on the environment.
