# Environmental Biology

Environmental biology is the study of how living organisms interact with their natural surroundings. As an environmental biologist, I am interested in understanding the impact of human activities on the environment and finding ways to mitigate these effects.

## Species Management

One important aspect of environmental biology is species management. To effectively manage species populations, I have developed a Python class called `EnvironmentalBiology`. This class allows me to keep track of different species and their populations.

### Adding a Species

To add a species to the population, I can use the `add_species` method. This method takes the species name as an input and appends it to the species list.

### Removing a Species

If I want to remove a species from the population, I can use the `remove_species` method. This method takes the species name as an input and removes it from the species list if it exists.

### Getting Species Population

To retrieve the current population of species, I can use the `get_species_population` method. This method returns the length of the species list, which represents the number of species in the population.

## Conclusion

With the `EnvironmentalBiology` class, I can easily manage species populations and analyze their trends over time. By understanding the dynamics of these populations, I can contribute to the conservation and preservation of biodiversity in our environment.
